## üñºÔ∏è Overview

This repository showcases how ZenML can be used for machine learning with a Git 
Ops workflow. This allows data scientists to automatically test their models on 
staging and deploy to production. Here's an architecture diagram of what this 
can look like:

The workflow works as follows:

A data scientist wants to make improvements to the ML pipeline. They clone the 
repository, create a new branch, and experiment with new models or data 
processing steps on their local machine.

Once the data scientist thinks they have improved the pipeline, they create a 
pull request for his branch on GitHub. This automatically triggers a GitHub Action 
that will run the same pipeline in the staging environment (e.g. a pipeline 
running on a cloud stack in GCP), potentially with different test data. As long
as the  pipeline does not run successfully in the staging environment, the PR
cannot be  merged.

Once the PR has been reviewed and passes all checks, the branch is merged into 
main. This automatically triggers another GitHub Action that now runs a 
pipeline in the production environment, which trains the same model on 
production data, and then automatically deploys it.

## üëÄ Set up

In order to run this repository, the following secrets need to be set in the repository:

```shell
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
GCP_CREDENTIALS
KUBEFLOW_NAMESPACE
KUBEFLOW_PASSWORD
KUBEFLOW_PRODUCTION_NAMESPACE
KUBEFLOW_PRODUCTION_PASSWORD
KUBEFLOW_PRODUCTION_USERNAME
KUBEFLOW_USERNAME
ZENML_HOST
ZENML_PASSWORD
ZENML_USERNAME

# Currently not used but WIP
KUBEFLOW_STAGING_NAMESPACE
KUBEFLOW_STAGING_PASSWORD
KUBEFLOW_STAGING_USERNAME
ZENML_PRODUCTION_STACK
ZENML_STAGING_STACK
```

## üèá How to run

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:zenml-io/zenml-gitflow.git
```

2. Install local requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run pipeline locally

```
python run.py
```

4. Make changes in a branch and create a PR to `main`: Will trigger a run in staging GCP Vertex!

5. Merge to `main` after staging github action is completed: Will trigger a run in production AWS Kubeflow!
